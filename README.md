## DevScope Dashboard

DevScope is a frontend performance monitoring dashboard built using React.  
It visualizes real browser-based metrics such as page load time, user interactions, render cycles, FPS, and a derived performance score — all without a backend.

- Live FPS (Frames Per Second) tracking via `requestAnimationFrame`
- User interaction tracking (clicks & key events)
- Controlled component render count
- Dynamic performance score calculation
- Interactive charts for live metrics visualization
- Dark / Light mode toggle
- Responsive and clean dashboard UI
